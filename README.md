# `MUExplorer` #

**`MUExplorer`** is an interactive MATLAB GUI for manually identifying and refining motor unit templates from high-density surface EMG (HDsEMG) signals. It allows users to click-select spike events, generate templates, run template-matching convolution, and export results in a DEMUSE-compatible format.

---

## üöÄ Features

- Visualizes multi-channel HDsEMG data with per-channel vertical stacking
- Manual spike peak selection and template averaging
- Matched filter convolution for spike detection
- Subtraction of detected motor units to reveal residual activity
- Zooming, panning, and keyboard-driven interaction
- Supports export in [DEMUSE-compatible format](https://demuse.feri.um.si/)
- Handles data from synchronized `.mat` recordings and provides GUI layout for reviewing and editing MU templates

## Quick Start
1. Download and unzip this repo.
2. Copy/paste @MUExplorer into whatever MATLAB workspace folder you like. Make sure your MATLAB Editor workspace path is set to that folder.
3. Inside @MUExplorer folder there is a `config.yaml` if you want to use the auto file-name parsing/loading, you will want to update:
  + DataRoot, InputSubfolder, InputSuffix, and LayoutFile - Set this to the folder containing your experiment data folders. Structure should be:
  ```
    <Your DataRoot Folder>/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ <Your SessionName Folder, e.g. "Max_2025_05_20" for SessionName>
    |  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ <LayoutFile (e.g. "tmsi_layout.mat")> -- Should contain REMAP indexing vector, such that `obj.Data = data(REMAP,:);` puts the rows in order according to the grid layout specified in the Grids array of config.yaml.
    |  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ <InputSubfolder> (can be multiple "/" delimited filepath levels)
    |       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ<Your data file(s) (e.g. "Max_2025_05_20_2_synchronized.mat" where _synchronized.mat is <InputSuffix> and 2 is ExperimentNum)>
    |
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ <Your Other Session Folders...>
  ```
  + `DemuseInputSubfolder` - If loading using `DEMUSE` results, where to look for those (within `SessionName` folder)
  + `OutputSubfolder` - Where the saved results files are stored.

You can open the app by either giving your data directly, i.e. if you have `N` channels x `M` samples data in time-series `data` with sample rate `fs`, then you can simply specify:
```
app = MUExplorer(data, fs);
```
If you have a synchronization/reference indicator (i.e. a discrete indicator of when the desired contraction levels were happening throughout your experiment), then it should be given as a `1 x M` array `sync`:
```
app = MUExplorer(data, fs, sync);
```
If you've set up the folder data structure, then you can also load in a specific experiment using string `sessionName` and integer `experimentNum` e.g.
```
sessionName = "Max_2025_05_20";
experimentNum = 5;
app = MUExplorer(sessionName, experimentNum);
```
If you set up your folders and config first, this way is preferred because ultimately it can make dealing with the data easier. For one-off ad hoc usage it will probably be easier to use by specifying the data, sample rate, and ref/sync signal explicitly.  

To automatically populate the file selection dialog for loading DEMUSE results with experiment/session data:
```
app = MUExplorer(sessionName, experimentNum, true);
```

## Usage
If you are starting a file from scratch, you can loosely follow these step:
1. Hold control and left-click on a region that looks like it has spikes (use ref signal in background on top, plus you should know what spikes look like)
2. Left-click near peaks of prominent spikes. Do this for several instances where the waveform shape looks the same.
3. Press enter.
4. Return to full timescale mode by scrolling backwards on mouse wheel.
5. Hopefully now you see some reasonably "peaky" looking train on the bottom axis where the impulses correlate with what you'd expect based on ref signal.
6. Right-click to set the upper bound on the bottom axis (red line) to exclude very high points.
7. Left-click to set the lower bound on the bottom axis (blue line) if you need to adjust it now the template has been generated.
8. Regenerate the template for this grouping by pressing enter.
 + Hopefully by now you have a template waveform with reasonable looking spatial localization (bottom-left inset).
 + You can iteratively continue this procedure, or you can press `n` to create a new template grouping and continue.
9. When you're done, press `CTRL + S` to save (for MUExplorer), or if you want to look at the output in DEMUSE tool, press `ALT + S` to export a matfile that you can load into DEMUSE using the `Load Results` button directly.
