# `MUExplorer` #

**`MUExplorer`** is an interactive MATLAB GUI for manually identifying and refining motor unit templates from high-density surface EMG (HDsEMG) signals. It allows users to click-select spike events, generate templates, run template-matching convolution, and export results in a DEMUSE-compatible format.

## üöÄ Features

- Visualizes multi-channel HDsEMG data with per-channel vertical stacking
- Manual spike peak selection and template averaging
- Matched filter convolution for spike detection
- Subtraction of detected motor units to reveal residual activity
- Zooming, panning, and keyboard-driven interaction
- Supports export in [DEMUSE-compatible format](https://demuse.feri.um.si/)
- Handles data from synchronized `.mat` recordings and provides GUI layout for reviewing and editing MU templates

## Quick Start
1. Download and unzip this repo.
2. Copy/paste @MUExplorer into whatever MATLAB workspace folder you like. Make sure your MATLAB Editor workspace path is set to that folder.
3. Inside @MUExplorer folder there is a `config.yaml` if you want to use the auto file-name parsing/loading, you will want to update:
  + DataRoot, InputSubfolder, InputSuffix, and LayoutFile - Set this to the folder containing your experiment data folders. Structure should be:
  ```
    <Your DataRoot Folder>/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ <Your SessionName Folder, e.g. "Max_2025_05_20" for SessionName>
    |  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ <LayoutFile (e.g. "tmsi_layout.mat")> -- Should contain REMAP indexing vector, such that `obj.Data = data(REMAP,:);` puts the rows in order according to the grid layout specified in the Grids array of config.yaml.
    |  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ <InputSubfolder> (can be multiple "/" delimited filepath levels)
    |       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ<Your data file(s) (e.g. "Max_2025_05_20_2_synchronized.mat" where _synchronized.mat is <InputSuffix> and 2 is ExperimentNum)>
    |
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ <Your Other Session Folders...>
  ```

You can open the app by either giving your data directly, i.e. if you have `N` channels x `M` samples data in time-series `data` with sample rate `fs`, then you can simply specify:
```
app = MUExplorer(data, fs);
```
If you have a synchronization/reference indicator (i.e. a discrete indicator of when the desired contraction levels were happening throughout your experiment), then it should be given as a `1 x M` array `sync`:
```
app = MUExplorer(data, fs, sync);
```
If you've set up the folder data structure, then you can also load in a specific experiment using string `sessionName` and integer `experimentNum` e.g.
```
sessionName = "Max_2025_05_20";
experimentNum = 5;
app = MUExplorer(sessionName, experimentNum);
```
If you set up your folders and config first, this way is preferred because ultimately it can make dealing with the data easier. For one-off ad hoc usage it will probably be easier to use by specifying the data, sample rate, and ref/sync signal explicitly.

## üíæ Output Format

Results can be saved in two formats:
- **Native Format** (`*_muresults.mat`): Includes templates, spikes, residuals, and GUI state.
- **DEMUSE-Compatible Format** (`*_DEMUSE.mat`): Includes `MUPulses`, `IPTs`, `PNR`, `SIG`, and `ref_signal` fields for downstream use with DEMUSE pipelines.
